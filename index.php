		This web page was created in a 
		spur of the moment inspiration.... 
		In addition to programming in VB.NET,
		I ride a Specialized roadbike,
		take photographs,
		travel and write for fun.
		Having degreed in Psychology back when, and... 
		spent years of working in IT for cruise lines,
		manufacturing and construction companies,
		I'm following the Software Engineering concentration at
		Harvard's Extension University ALM Program and 
		love to learn and understand new ideas and constructs 
		especially leading to the design and use of computers.
